        <dt>
          What age groups does Urbanplay work with?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          We work with kids ages between 6 to 18 years.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          How does programming differ between age groups?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          With our younger kids, we simplify the lessons and include more games and activities. With our older kids, depending on their maturity level, we offer more in-depth lessons and skills training and incorporate traditional workout formats (kickboxing, yoga, circuit training, etc.), goal setting, and coaching around health and fitness topics.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          What is the recommended class duration and frequency for the weekly program?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Class frequency and duration is flexible so it can meet the needs of the school/organization. UrbanPlay weekly program may meet every day or as little as once a week. One size does not fit all when it comes to health and we believe the same for our program. We will personally work with you to develop the optimal program for your school. Recommended class duration is 30-minutes up to 90-minutes and may depend on the frequency of the class.

          What is the coach to student ratio?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          We like to keep our coach to student ratio between 1:5 and 1:10 to ensure quality instruction.

        <dt>
          What is the space requirement for an UrbanPlay class?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Our program requires an open space where kids are able to safely move around. It can be both outdoors and indoors. The space requirement is dependent upon the number of participants per class. The space should be big enough so kids can freely move.

          What is the cost of the program?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Depending on the frequency of classes, the cost will differ. We recognize that each school/organization has different access to resources. Below is a sample pricing structure to give you a general idea:

        <dt>
          Do you have any scholarships to assist with the cost?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Yes. We have a scholarship program to assist covering partial costs for schools/organizations in that qualify through our application process.
